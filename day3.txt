typescript type
    dataType => values 
    java dataType =>(char,string,int,byte,double,
    float,boolen,long)

    typescript(javaScript)=>
    1)number(int and float)=>
    can hold integer value,fraction values,0x hexadecimal
    octal 0o377,binary values 0b11101011.
    2)string =>
    contain sequence of char ""|'', it will except expession inside the string 
    `${name}` syntax of expression in ts ${name}
    ,
    3)null =>
    it will repreent the variable with null value to indicate that it's not initialise
    the variable is undefined
    ,
    4)void =>
    retun type of function not return anything (void will return null),
    5)boolean =>
    boolean will consider two values (true,false),
    6)any type =>
         it's also one f dataType in typescript (super type),
         that varie which as any as it's type then that varable will except any type of value inside that 

     primitive dataType


typescript variables
    => CONTAINER which hold the value
    => syntax 
    => let|var variable_name:type = value;

    Annotation(: we use annotation to mention the type )
    it can annotation can be used anywhere (variable|function etc)

typescript annotation
    Annotation(: we use annotation to mention the type )
    it can annotation can be used anywhere (variable|function etc)
    inner annotation and general annotation


typescript inference
    the process of complier will decide the type of variable based on it's value that process is called inferring
typescript assertion
    it's process of inform the complier to the type of variable
    typecasting in java is knothing but assertion in TS
    using as keyword 
    Anglar Brackets <>
typescript array,tuple,union,string,numers
    Array =>
        it's a hold sequence data element of same dataType
        to access of element of array index
        first index of array is 0
        javaScript => array of different dataType
        typescript will help you create array which hold the homogineas element
    union
        => the process of mention multiple type for a single variable the process is called union
        union ca represent (|)
    tuple
        =>which hold the multiple type values in datastructure
        =>it's dont have  index;
    string
        =>sequence of char
